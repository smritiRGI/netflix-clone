# Javascript Callbacks

A callback is a function passed as argument to another function.<br>
Promises are ideal for multiple callbacks and used for asynchronous operations.<br>
A promise is either fulfilled or rejected.

# axios

axios is a promise based javascript library for making HTTP requests. Response is in JSON.<br>
Installing axios - npm install axios <br>
**axios.create ()** - creates an instance of axios which you can reuse for multiple requests. for example - set a common timeout for all requests.

# React Hooks

useState - track state in a functional component.<br>
**const [var , setVar ] = UseState([]);** <br>
setVar - function to update the state<br>
useState - holds the current state<br>

# String Interpolation

String interpolation is replacing placeholders with values in a string literal.<br>
`${greeting}, ${who}!` is a template string having placeholders ${greeting} and ${who}.<br>

On script execution, the first placeholder ${greeting} is replaced with the value of greeting variable, and the same for ${who}. The string interpolation result is 'Hello, World!'.

# Optional Chaining Operator

operator chaining - automatically checks if a particular object is null or undefined .
example - movie?.title
